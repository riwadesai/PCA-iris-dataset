# PCA-iris-dataset
 Compute principal component analysis for the 4 numeric variables in the imported variables.
• Report the first two principal component loading vectors.
• Report the first two principal components. What proportion of vari- ance is explained by them.
• Plot all the points (150) using the first two principal components.
• Create separate plots (using the first two principal components) for each species type and combine them all into a single graph. Use color or different symbols to distinguish between different species types.
